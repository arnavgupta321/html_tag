    <p>Sundar Pichai was born on June 10, 1972, <B>in Madurai, India, and studied engineering at the Indian</B> Institute of Technology in
         Kharagpur. He earned a master's degree from <i>Stanford University and an MBA</i> from the Wharton School of the University of
          Pennsylvania.

        Pichai's early <strong> includes positions at Allied</strong> Materials and McKinsey & Co.
        
        Gaining Experience
        In 1997, Sundar Pichai abandoned the Ph.D. <i>program at Stanford University, accepting his master's degree</i> in material sciences
         and engineering. He joined Allied Materials, a semiconductor manufacturer in Silicon Valley, as a product manager before
          leaving to pursue an MBA at the University of Pennsylvania.<em> After graduation in 2002, Pichai</em> accepted a position as 
          a management consultant at McKinsey & Co. Having roles of both product manager and consultant at two leading firms, 
          which require product strategy, <br>execution, and team building, prepared Sundar Pichai for his new position at Google
           in 2004.
        
        Success at Google
        Sundar Pichai's interview at Google coincidently coincided <mark>with the launch of Google Gmail</mark>. Unaware of the new product,
         Pichai admitted his ignorance during his <small>interviews and is remembered as the candidate with</small> "intellectual humility," which 
         Laszlo Bock, Googleâ€™s <del>former senior VP of people operations,</del> called one of the top qualities he looked for in candidates at
          Google. Pichai was well-prepared but managed <ins>a dynamic situation</ins> with candor during a moment of uncertainty.
